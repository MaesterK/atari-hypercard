Atari VCS / 2600 Supercard with menu implemented for atari itself creating text based menu on the fly.
Uses programmable logic ic (GAL) as latch and nand chip to select and switch between images via adress bus. 
Works only with early ("dumb") images.

The assembly code for the menu build using DASM and the framework (mainly the definitions from vcs.h) from SvOlli's atari 2600 workshop (https://svolli.org/atari2600/)
